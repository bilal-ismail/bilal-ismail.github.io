- name: Variable Power Supply (220vac to 12vdc) 
  type: academic project
  domain: Circuit Design | Basic Electronics | Soldering
  start: 2015
  finish: 2015
  problem: Hands on understanding of variable power supplies, regulators and transformers
  solution: use of capacitors for signal filtering and reverse protection through diodes
  outcome: self-designed and implemented on spotted vero board with soldering iron practice

- name: Relay based Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) design
  type: DIY project
  domain: Circuits | Automation | Electronics
  start: 2016
  finish: 2016
  problem: Domestic use gensets have a common problem and an electric hazard of changing power sources. General relays usually get fried from continuous supply to the 220v relay
  solution: an economical yet intuitive approach to implement reverse logic through 12 voly relays
  outcome:  Hence, enhancing longevity of the relatively expensive relay

- name: Off-Road Buggy Project - Wild Wheelers
  type: academic competition project
  domain: Automotive | Off-Road | Safety | Electronics | Mechanical | Fabrication | Customization
  start: 2023
  finish: 2024
  problem: Inter-University competition for in-house off-road buggy manufacturing
  solution: with an off the shelf engine as per regulations and old scrap parts, an amazing machine was made. Capable of manuvering and powerful enough to fulfil the technical challenges
  outcome: The project won the 2nd runner up prize, as I was an active member of the team
