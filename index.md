## ICT Engineer — Networking, Security, AI & Robotics

My work spans public and enterprise environments, focusing on network programming, secure real-time systems, and resilient infrastructure. Over time, I have transitioned from communication-centric systems toward intelligent, automated solutions, with a growing focus on artificial intelligence and robotics.

This progression reflects a shift from building and securing networks to designing systems that can perceive, decide, and act reliably in real-world environments.
